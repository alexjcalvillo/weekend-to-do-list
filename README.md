# OrganizeMe (To-Do List)

## Description

_Duration: 48 Hour Sprint_

This application is for tracking the things you need to accomplish in a list format. Simply add an item with the details you want to keep and then mark the item complete once you have the work done.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `weekend-to-do-app.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
